A Repository of my MAGD 2023 Work
## A Semester Length Overview
Hello All! These are some of my top files from my 2023 MAGD school year!

#### _Project Two-Shapes_
For this project, we had to use different shapes to create a picture based on the chosen theme either **'Outer Space'** or **'Balloons'**
I used mostly the _quad_ function to complete this piece, using _RGB Mode_ as a color source.
I choose the theme **Outer Space**, depicting a Rocket in the sky
I learned a lot about how to use different shapes in a composition

#### _Project Four- Mouse and Key press_
For this project, we used the **Mouse Clicked** and **Key is Pressed** functions to make a piece that would change based on the interaction a user has with their control pad
I used coloration in different circles to defien when you click a key or on the mouse.
We also learned the **loop** function, which allowed me to make _repeating_ rectangles
I learned a lot about how to start using interaction bewteen user and interface

#### _Project Six - Aray_
For this project, we were learning the **Aray** Function, with the choice of theme of either _Halloween_, _Retro Games_, or _Nature_.
I choose Retro Games, and used _Pac-Man_ as my main point of focus.
I have an Aray following the user's mouse creating a follwing effect
This lab allowed me to experiment with different effects as well as moving targets
